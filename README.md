# Restaurant-App-Using-Custom-API
Front End Application using custom built web API. The API I created is connected to MongoDB and fetches restaurant data. The front end uses JQuery, Lodash, Leaflet, and Bootstrap to present the information and Pagination to navigate between data.

The Application is hosted at: https://dreamy-borg-5c3ea8.netlify.app/#

MORE INFORMATION/SPECS:

This front end application uses a custom built web API that uses Express/NodeJS/MongoDB to fetch data from the MongoDB Restaurants Sample Data. It uses the fetch() API to deliver dynamic content to a Lodash template which in turn renders all of the restaurants for a page. In addition, each time a table row is clicked, a JQuery event handler is triggered to render a map of the current restaurants address using Leaflet library.

Furthermore, this application makes use of Bootstrap and it's grid system for responsive design and Pagination for moving between pages.
